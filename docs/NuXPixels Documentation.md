## Intro

_NuXPixels_ is a small C++ library for 2D graphics rendering. It is designed to be self contained with no operating system dependencies and focuses on a minimal API with high quality anti‑aliasing. The renderer operates entirely in memory.

## Quickstart

```cpp
#include "NuXPixels.h"
using namespace NuXPixels;

int main() {
       SelfContainedRaster<ARGB32> canvas(IntRect(0, 0, 64, 64));
       Path rect;
       rect.addRect(IntRect(8, 8, 48, 48));
       PolygonMask mask(rect, canvas.calcBounds());
       canvas |= Solid<ARGB32>(0xFFFF0000) * mask; // fill red square

       FILE* f = fopen("out.ppm", "wb");
       fprintf(f, "P6\n64 64\n255\n");
       const ARGB32::Pixel* p = canvas.getPixelPointer();
       for (int i = 0; i < 64 * 64; ++i) {
               unsigned char rgb[3] = {
                       static_cast<unsigned char>(p[i] >> 16),
                       static_cast<unsigned char>(p[i] >> 8),
                       static_cast<unsigned char>(p[i])
               };
               fwrite(rgb, 1, 3, f);
       }
       fclose(f);
       return 0;
}
```

Compile with `g++ example.cpp -std=c++17` (or a similar C++17 compiler command).

## Core Data Types

### Points and Rectangles
`NuXPixels` defines generic `Point<T>` and `Rect<T>` templates for integer and floating point coordinates. Convenience typedefs such as `IntPoint`, `IntRect` and `Vertex` (a double precision point) are available for common use.

`Rect<T>` uses half‑open bounds `[left, left+width) × [top, top+height)` and expects non‑negative `width` and `height`. When rectangles only touch at an edge the intersection is empty. `IntRect` stores 31‑bit signed coordinates (`FULL_RECT` spans ±0x40000000) while floating variants rely on `double`. `Rect<T>` provides helpers like `offset`, `calcUnion` and `calcIntersection` to manipulate regions.
These operations simplify clipping logic:

```cpp
IntRect a(0, 0, 50, 50);
IntRect b(20, 20, 10, 10);
IntRect clipped = a.calcIntersection(b);
```

### Pixel Formats
The library ships with a few pixel formats. `ARGB32` stores premultiplied 8‑bit channels in `0xAARRGGBB` order. A lightweight `Mask8` type carries 8‑bit coverage when rendering masks.

### Color Math
Pixels are interpreted as sRGB and all arithmetic happens in that gamma space; no linear conversion is performed. Blending follows the conventional `dst * (255 - src.a) / 255 + src` equation on premultiplied channels, where `src.a` is the source alpha (0–255). Intermediate arithmetic uses integers with truncation, so channel multiplications round toward zero. `ARGB32` provides utilities such as `add`, `multiply` and `interpolate` for pixel arithmetic. A color can be constructed from floats and then modulated:

```cpp
ARGB32::Pixel p = ARGB32::fromFloatRGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5); // 50% red
ARGB32::Pixel dark = ARGB32::multiply(p, 128);               // scale alpha & rgb by 128/255
// If using a literal, red opaque is 0xFFFF0000, blue is 0xFF0000FF.
```

### AffineTransformations
`AffineTransformation` represents 2×3 matrices for translation, scaling, rotation and shearing. Transformations can be composed with the `transform()` function and applied to vertices or paths.

Chained calls build complex transforms in a readable manner:

```cpp
AffineTransformation t = AffineTransformation()
	.translate(20, 10)
	.scale(2)
	.rotate(0.25 * M_PI);
```

Transforms are pre‑multiplied (points are column vectors), so calls execute left‑to‑right: `translate().scale().rotate()` means translate, then scale, then rotate in object space. Angles are specified in radians.

## Rendering Pipeline

### Raster and Renderer
All drawing is expressed through `Renderer` templates that generate spans of
pixel data. A span models a contiguous horizontal run. When marked *solid* the
span stores one pixel value repeated for the entire run; otherwise it carries an
array of per-pixel values so coverage or color may vary across the span. Each
span also flags opaque or transparent runs to enable culling. Spans longer than
`MAX_RENDER_LENGTH` are split automatically. `Raster<T>` collects the result in a client supplied buffer while `SelfContainedRaster<T>` manages its own memory. A typical pipeline blends color data from `Renderer<ARGB32>` through coverage masks produced by `Renderer<Mask8>` sources.

```cpp
ARGB32::Pixel pixels[1024 * 1024];
Raster<ARGB32> view(pixels, 1024, IntRect(0, 0, 1024, 1024), false);
view |= Solid<ARGB32>(0xFFFF0000); // fill raster red
```

### PolygonMask
`PolygonMask` is the workhorse renderer for filling paths. Given a vector `Path`
and an optional fill rule, it converts the geometry into a scanline coverage mask
(`Renderer<Mask8>`). Paint sources such as solid colors or gradients are then
blended through this mask onto the destination raster. Scanlines are processed
sequentially from top to bottom. Coverage values range 0–255 with 8‑bit subpixel
precision, and both even‑odd and non‑zero winding rules are supported. The
constructor accepts an optional clip rectangle (defaulting to `FULL_RECT`), which
is clamped to the maximum coordinate range and applied before rasterization.

Further details on the algorithm, design trade‑offs and pseudo‑code are available in `PolygonMask Rasterizer.md`.

### Gradients
A `Gradient` lookup table produces color values for linear or radial fills.
`LinearAscend` and `RadialAscend` generate a 0–255 coverage ramp that can index
into a gradient: `gradient[LinearAscend(x0, y0, x1, y1)]` or
`gradient[RadialAscend(cx, cy, rx, ry)]` yield a color renderer. The library also
provides a `GammaTable` for simple tone adjustments.

Stops must be supplied in ascending order and are interpolated in premultiplied
space. The ramp spans indices `0–255` inclusive and clamps at the ends; gradients
neither repeat nor reflect. Large color steps may band since no dithering is
applied.

```cpp
Gradient<ARGB32>::Stop stops[] = {
	{0.0, 0xFF0000FF},// blue
	{1.0, 0xFFFFFFFF}// white
};
Gradient<ARGB32> grad(2, stops);
canvas |= grad[LinearAscend(0, 0, 0, 100)];

Gradient<ARGB32>::Stop stops2[] = {
{0.0, 0xFFFF0000},// red
{1.0, 0xFFFFFFFF}
};
```
See [Lifetime of Renderers](#lifetime-of-renderers) for notes on gradient lookups referencing their ramps.


### Solid and Texture
`Solid<T>` outputs a constant pixel value. `Texture<T>` samples from a raster using an affine
transformation and optional wrapping (repeat when `wrap=true`, otherwise clamp to transparent black). Sampling uses 16.16 fixed-point coordinates with bilinear filtering.

```cpp
Texture<ARGB32> tex(image, true, AffineTransformation().scale(0.5));
canvas |= tex * mask; // Defaults: bilinear filter, wrap repeat
// Clamp with wrap=false to sample transparent black; sampling happens in premultiplied space.
```

### RLERaster
`RLERaster<T>` stores spans in run-length encoded form for reuse. It is handy for caching
masks so that complex paths need not be rasterized repeatedly.

```cpp
RLERaster<Mask8> cache(area, mask);
canvas |= Solid<ARGB32>(color) * cache;
```

Runs encode either a solid pixel or a block of per‑pixel data. Each span stores a 16‑bit header plus optional pixel payload, preserving partial alpha. Compression ratio depends on image coherence—solid regions compress heavily while noisy images approach raw size.

## Operator Overloading
Renderers can be combined with `*`, `+`, `|`, `+=`, `*=`, and `|=` operators.
Each operator returns another `Renderer` that lazily requests spans from its
inputs. An expression like `canvas |= Solid<ARGB32>(color) * mask` forms a small
pipeline. Operator precedence follows C++ rules: `*` binds tighter than `|`. The
`|` operator blends the right renderer over the left; it is not a bitwise OR.

## Pull Model
As the canvas renders, it pulls spans from the expression and each stage only
computes what the next stage requires. Because drawing is demand driven,
NuXPixels can optimize away work in real time. Opaque spans automatically block
processing of any renderers beneath them since those pixels are invisible. This
culling happens per span and keeps the renderer efficient even with many
layers.

## Lifetime of Renderers
Most renderer types store references to the objects passed into their
constructors or operators. C++ destroys temporary objects at the end of the
statement, so a renderer built from temporaries must also be used in that same
statement. To keep a renderer for later, create and store every component
separately so their lifetimes extend as needed.

```cpp
Gradient<ARGB32>::Stop stops[] = {{0.0, 0xff0000ff}, {1.0, 0xffffffff}};
Gradient<ARGB32> grad(2, stops);
LinearAscend ramp(x0, y0, x1, y1);
Lookup<ARGB32, LookupTable<ARGB32> > lookup = grad[ramp];
canvas |= lookup; /// `grad` and `ramp` must outlive `lookup`

canvas |= Gradient<ARGB32>(2, stops)[LinearAscend(x0, y0, x1, y1)]; /// safe: everything is temporary
```

This rule applies to all expressions in NuXPixels—`PolygonMask`, `Texture`,
`Solid`, gradients and more. Either chain the full expression in a single
statement or keep each renderer alive for as long as any derived renderer uses
it.

Even types that are trivially copyable still reference external data; treat renderers as views rather than owning objects.

| Renderer | References | Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Solid<T> | none | value |
| Texture<T> | source `Raster<T>` | no |
| PolygonMask | `Path`, `FillRule` | no |
| Gradient<T> | copy of stops | table |
| Gradient<T>::Lookup | gradient, ramp | no |
| RLERaster<T> | none | owns span/pixel arrays |

## Path Construction
`Path` records drawing commands such as `moveTo`, `lineTo`, `quadraticTo`, `cubicTo`, `arcSweep` and `close`. Convenience helpers like `addRect`, `addEllipse`, `addCircle`, `addRoundedRect` and `addStar` append common shapes. `stroke` replaces the path with its stroked outline while `dash` rewrites segments to alternate drawn and skipped portions. All operations modify the path in place but return `*this` for chaining. Paths operate in double precision and can be transformed with an `AffineTransformation` before rendering.

```cpp
Path star;
star.addStar(40, 40, 5, 20, 10, 0);
star.stroke(3.0, Path::ROUND, Path::MITER);
star.dash(5.0, 2.0);
```

`stroke(width, endCaps, joints, miterLimit, curveQuality)` defaults to a miter limit of `2.0`. `EndCapStyle` may be `BUTT`, `ROUND`, or `SQUARE`; `JointStyle` is `BEVEL`, `CURVE`, or `MITER`. `dash(dashLength, gapLength, dashOffset)` alternates drawn and skipped segments starting at `dashOffset`; fractional lengths accumulate along each sub-path and the pattern resets at every `moveTo`.

## Limits and Safety

- Maximum span length is 256 pixels (`MAX_RENDER_LENGTH`); longer runs are split automatically.
- `IntRect` uses 31‑bit signed coordinates (`FULL_RECT`); floating types use `double` values.
- Texture sampling outside the source repeats when `wrap=true` and returns transparent black (`0x00000000`) when `wrap=false`.
- Renderers and rasters are not thread‑safe; use separate instances on different threads.
- Requesting scanlines out of order forces `PolygonMask` to rewind and resort edges, which is slower than sequential rendering.
- `RLERaster` compresses runs; memory usage varies with image content.
- Paths with fewer than two points or zero-length segments yield zero coverage.
- Color and coverage calculations use 8‑bit integer arithmetic with truncation.
- Many routines assume coordinates roughly within -32768 to 32767; exceeding that range can overflow internal 16-bit accumulators or lose precision. Int operations clamp to 31-bit ranges (`IntRect` uses ±0x40000000).
- Functions do not guarantee `noexcept` and may fail on allocation.

## Examples and Recipes

A short example shows how the operator overloads work together:

```cpp
using namespace NuXPixels;

SelfContainedRaster<ARGB32> canvas(IntRect(0, 0, 64, 64));

Path rect;
rect.addRect(IntRect(8, 8, 48, 48));
PolygonMask mask(rect, canvas.calcBounds());

// Multiply the coverage mask with a solid color and alpha-blend onto the canvas
canvas |= Solid<ARGB32>(0xFFFF0000) * mask;
```
Here `*` multiplies the color renderer with the `PolygonMask`, producing
`Renderer<ARGB32>` spans masked by the polygon coverage. The resulting renderer
is then blended onto `canvas` with `|=`. The entire expression becomes a pull
pipeline: the canvas requests pixels, which asks the mask for coverage, which in
turn iterates the path only for the visible spans. Similar expressions can chain
gradients or multiple masks together.

This program (including file output) is available as `tests/red_square.cpp`.

Another example uses a texture and gradient:

```cpp
SelfContainedRaster<ARGB32> texCanvas(IntRect(0, 0, 64, 64));
Gradient<ARGB32> grad(ARGB32::transparent(), 0xFF00FF00); // 0xAARRGGBB: green
texCanvas |= grad[RadialAscend(32, 32, 32, 32)];

Texture<ARGB32> tex(texCanvas, true);
canvas |= tex * mask;
```
