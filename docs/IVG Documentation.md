## Intro

_IVG_ (_Imperative Vector Graphics_) is a compact, easy-to-read 2D vector graphics format and rendering engine built on
top of a simple imperative language called _ImpD_. It allows the creation of generative graphics that can adapt to input
parameters rather than just describing static images.

_IVG_ is easy to integrate into existing C++ projects and has no dependencies on other libraries or operating system
function calls. It uses a low-level 2D rendering C++ library called _NuXPixels_ (included in the distribution), which is
light on the CPU and provides high-quality anti-aliasing.

In _IVG_, the graphics are described using a set of drawing instructions, which are interpreted by _ImpD_ and then sent
to the _NuXPixels_ engine to produce the final pixel raster. These instructions include basic shapes like rectangles,
ellipses, and stars and more advanced options like paths, images, and text. Additionally, the _IVG_ format includes
options for styling and transforming the graphics, such as setting colors, gradients, and patterns for fills and
strokes, as well as applying transformations like scaling, rotating, and skewing.

To give you a better idea of how _IVG_ works, here's an example of a simple source code that creates a smiley face:

    // IVG and ImpD version.
    format IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1
    
    // Set the canvas bounds to 400x400 pixels.
    bounds 0,0,400,400
    
    // Wipe the canvas with a deep red fill.
    WIPE maroon
    
    // Set the fill color to yellow.
    fill yellow
    
    // Draw the face.
    ELLIPSE 200,200,150
    
    // Set the fill color to black.
    fill black
    
    // Draw the eyes.
    ELLIPSE 150,170,25
    ELLIPSE 250,170,25
    
    // Draw the mouth using a SVG path.
    PATH svg:[M 150,270 Q 200,320 250,270]
![](images/smiley.png)

This is just a simple example, but it demonstrates the basic structure and syntax of an _IVG_ document. As you continue
reading the documentation, you will learn about all the different instructions and options available in _IVG_ and how to
use them to create your vector graphics.

It's worth noting that basic knowledge of the _ImpD_ language is necessary to understand and use the _IVG_ format fully.
For more information on _ImpD_, please refer to the separate [_ImpD documentation_](ImpD%20Documentation.html) provided.
It will cover how to use variables and control flow statements to create dynamic and interactive graphics.

The _ImpD format_ used in this documentation is `IVG-2`. Therefore, the `format` instruction should be as follows:

    format IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1

Notice that _ImpD_ is case-insensitive, but in this document, we follow a convention where we have written "directives"
(defining settings, etc.) in lowercase and drawing instructions in uppercase.

## IVG-1 vs IVG-2

`IVG-1` covers core vector drawing, styling, text, and fonts.
`IVG-2` extends the format with raster image support through `define image` and `IMAGE`.

The interpreter processes both versions identically, but readers that only understand `IVG-1`
will reject documents marked `IVG-2`.

## Instructions

### ELLIPSE

The `ELLIPSE` instruction draws an ellipse or circle shape on the canvas. It will be filled with the current
[`fill`](#fill) setting and outlined with the current [`pen`](#pen) setting.

Syntax:

    ELLIPSE <cx>,<cy>,(<r>|<rx>,<ry>)

-   `<cx>,<cy>` is the center point of the ellipse.

-   `(<r>|<rx>,<ry>)` is the radius of the ellipse. If you only provide one value, it will be used as the radius for
    both the x and y axis, creating a circle.

Example:

    bounds 0,0,300,200
    
    // Wipe the canvas with near-white.
    WIPE #E0E0E0
    
    // Fill a red circle.
    fill #802020
    ELLIPSE 150,100,80
    
    // Outline a flat ellipse, rotated 10 degrees clockwise around its center.
    fill none
    pen #802020 width:5
    rotate 10 anchor:150,100
    ELLIPSE 150,100,140,30
![](images/ellipseExample.png)

### IMAGE

You use the `IMAGE` instruction for drawing an image on the canvas. The image can be a previously defined image created
with the [`define image`](#define-image) directive or an external resource specified by its name or file path.

Syntax:

    IMAGE <x>,<y> <name>
          [ align:top|middle|bottom left|center|right="top left" ]
          [ clip:<x>,<y>,<w>,<h> ]
          [ width:<width> ]
          [ height:<height> ]
          [ stretch:(yes|no)=yes ]
          [ transform:<transform> ]
          [ opacity:<opacity> ]

-   The `<x>,<y>` coordinates specify the position of the image. By default, the image's top-left corner is placed on
    these coordinates, but you can choose the alignment with the 'align' option.

-   `<name>` is the name of the image, either defined with [`define image`](#define-image) or an external resource name
    or path.

-   The `align` option specifies the image's alignment on the canvas. The default value is `top left`.

-   The `clip` option is used to define a clipping rectangle in source image coordinates to limit the area of the image
    that will be drawn.

-   The `width` and `height` options fit the source image into a specific width and height.

-   If `stretch` is `no` and `width` and/or `height` is supplied, the source image preserves its aspect ratio and fits within those dimensions. Otherwise, it stretches the image to fill the specified `width` and/or `height` exactly.

-   The `transform` option is used to apply a transformation to the image when it is drawn. See [Transform
    Specification](#transform-specification)

-   The `opacity` option is used to set the image's opacity. A value of 1 (or `#FF`) is fully opaque, and 0 is fully
    transparent.

`IMAGE` uses _bilinear interpolation_ when executing all transformations, resulting in efficient performance. However,
it is important to note that large rescales may result in low image quality.

Demonstration:

    format IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1
    bounds 0,0,340,300
    options aa-gamma:1.5

### PATH

The `PATH` instruction is used for drawing a path from SVG data. It will be filled with the current [`fill`](#fill)
setting and outlined with the current [`pen`](#pen) setting.

Syntax:

    PATH svg:<svg data>

-   `<svg data>` is a string containing the SVG path data.

See https://svgwg.org/specs/paths/ for documentation on the SVG path format.

Example:

    format IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1
    bounds 0,0,400,380
    
    // Wipe the canvas with a very dark purple
    WIPE rgb(0.1,0.0,0.1)
    
    // Pink fill and red transparent outline
    fill rgb(0.9,0.5,0.7)
    pen rgb(0.5,0.2,0.2,0.5) width:20
    
    // Rotate the canvas
    rotate -135 anchor:200,200
    
    // Draw the heart path
    PATH svg:[M100,300 v-200 h200 a100,100,90,0,1,0,200 a100,100,90,0,1,-200,0 z]
![](images/svgPathExample.png)

### LINE

The `LINE` instruction draws an open polyline using the current [`pen`](#pen).

Syntax:

    LINE <x0>,<y0>[,<x1>,<y1> ...]

At least two points (four coordinates) are required. Two points draw a single line segment; additional points extend the polyline.

Example:

    pen black width:2
    LINE 10,10, 80,40, 40,80

### POLYGON

The `POLYGON` instruction draws a closed polygon using the current [`fill`](#fill) and [`pen`](#pen).

Syntax:

    POLYGON <x0>,<y0>[,<x1>,<y1> ...]

At least three points (six coordinates) are required. The polygon is automatically closed.

Example:

    fill lime
    pen black
    POLYGON 20,20, 120,20, 120,80, 20,80

### RECT

You use the `RECT` instruction to draw a rectangle shape. It will be filled with the current [`fill`](#fill) setting and
outlined with the current [`pen`](#pen) setting.

Syntax:

    RECT <x>,<y>,<w>,<h> [rounded:<r>|<rx>,<ry>]

-   `<x>,<y>,<w>,<h>` is a rectangle specification in the format of x,y,w,h.

-   The `rounded` option specifies the radius of the rounded corners. You specify the radius as a single value for all
    corners or as separate values for the x and y radius.

Example:

    format IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1
    bounds 0,0,300,80
    
    // Draw a dark blue rectangle.
    fill #406080
    RECT 60,10,180,60
    
    // Draw a brighter rounded rectangle on top with a white outline.
    fill #80C0E0
    pen #C0E0E0
    RECT 80,20,140,40 rounded:30,20
![](images/rectExample.png)

### STAR

The `STAR` instruction is used for drawing a star shape or regular polygon. It will be filled with the current
[`fill`](#fill) setting and outlined with the current [`pen`](#pen) setting.

Syntax:

    STAR <cx>,<cy>,<points>,<r1>[,<r2>=<r1>] [rotation:<angle>]

-   `<cx>, <cy>` are the x and y coordinates of the center of the star.

-   `<points>` is the number of points of the star.

-   `<r1> and <r2>` are the inner and outer radius of the star. If only `<r1>` is specified, it will be used for both
    the inner and outer radius (effectively creating a regular polygon).

-   The `rotation` option specifies the angle of rotation for the star in degrees.

This example shows the effect of varying the number of points and the proportion of `<r2>` to `<r1>`:

    format IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1
    bounds 0,0,540,420
    options aa-gamma:1.5
    
    // Black canvas, white pen and maroon fill.
    WIPE black
    pen white
    fill navy
    
    // White serif font face, size 20.
    font serif size:20 color:white
    
    // Setup a list of star point counts.
    counts = [3,4,5,6,8,10,12]
    
    // Loop through a list of <r2> to <r1> proportions.
    offset 60,0
    for r2 in:[100,80,60,40,20,0] [
        context [
            // Draw a label indicating the proportion on this row.
            TEXT at:15,45 $r2% anchor:right
    
            // Loop through the list of star point counts.
            for c in:$counts [
                // Offset 60 pixels to the right on each iteration.
                offset 60,0
    
                // Draw a star with the current point count and radius values.
                STAR 0,40,$c,20,{20*$r2%}
            ]
        ]
    
        // Offset 60 pixels down on each iteration
        offset 0,60
    ]
    
    // Loop through the list of star point counts.
    for c in:[3,4,5,6,8,10,12] [
        // Offset 60 pixels to the right on each iteration
        offset 60,0
    
        // Draw a label indicating the point count for this column.
        TEXT at:0,30 $c anchor:center
    ]
![](images/starExample.png)

### TEXT

You use the `TEXT` instruction for drawing text on the canvas. It uses the current font settings for its text style.

Syntax:

    TEXT [at:<x,y>] [anchor:left|center|right=left] [caret:<variable>] <text>

-   The `at` option specifies the x,y coordinates of the text. If not present, the text will continue to the right of
    the last written string.

-   The `anchor` option specifies the horizontal alignment of the text. The default value is `left`, and anything else
    requires the `at` argument.

-   The `caret` option specifies a variable that will be set to the final horizontal caret position, i.e., the position
    where the next character would have been written.

-   `<text>` is the text to be drawn on the canvas. `TEXT` draws a single line of text only.

Demonstration:

    FORMAT IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1
    options aa-gamma:1.5
    
    bounds 0,0,440,80
    WIPE hsv(0.5,0.8,0.1)
     
    // Setup parameters for drawing the text.
    s="Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet"
    size=24
    x=220
    y=45
    margin=15
    
    /*
        The shear transformation creates a slant, and the tracking value increases the space
        between letters. IVG in itself has no built-in fonts, but "serif", "sans-serif" and
        "code" are used when creating this documentation (and they are included in ivgfiddle).
    */
    font serif size:$size color:hsv(0.47,0.3,0.9) outline:black
        .. transform:[shear -0.3,0] tracking:0.1
    
    /*
        To measure the text, draw it centered around position, store the final x position in
        the variable `rx`
    */
    TEXT at:$x,$y $s anchor:center caret:rx
    
    // Setup fill and pen gradients for the box.
    fill gradient:[linear 0,18,0,40 from:hsv(0.5,0.5,0.2) to:hsv(0.5,0.7,0.6)]
    pen gradient:[radial $x,{$y-$size/3},{$rx-$x},$size
        .. from:hsv(0.4,0.7,0.9) to:hsv(0.5,0.7,0.4)] width:8.0
    
    /*
        Draw a rounded rect box around the text. The equations make the box dimensions adjust
        to the text width and height.
    */
    RECT {$x*2-$rx-$margin},{$y-$size*1.2},{$rx*2-$x*2+$margin*2},{$size*1.8}
        .. rounded:{$size*1.8/2}
    
    // Draw the final text.
    TEXT at:$x,$y $s anchor:center
![](images/textExample.png)

### WIPE

The `WIPE` instruction is used for painting over the entire canvas, except for any masked areas.

Syntax:

    WIPE <paint>

-   `<paint>` is the paint used for the wipe. You specify it as a color, gradient, or pattern. See [Paint
    Specification](#paint-specification) for more information. Note that _relative paint_ is not allowed for this
    instruction.

Example:

    format IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1
    bounds 0,0,200,200
    
    // Wipe the full canvas with a radial rainbow gradient
    WIPE gradient:[
        radial 100,100,100
        stops:[0,red,0.25,yellow,0.5,lime,0.75,aqua,1,blue]
    ]
![](images/wipeExample.png)

## Directives

### bounds

The `bounds` directive declares the outer boundaries of a _standalone_ canvas:

    bounds <x>,<y>,<w>,<h>

You should only use it once at the top level of the document and once in each pattern and image definition. You must
declare it before the first drawing instruction. You may omit this directive if the canvas is not _standalone_ but part
of a shared drawing area.

Example:

    // Declare a 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels high canvas. The top-left corner is (10,50).
    bounds 10,50,400,300

### context

`context` declares a local group where all modified properties, masks, transforms, and definitions are restored when the
group ends.

    context <instructions>

Demonstration:

    format IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1
    bounds 0,0,300,300
    
    // Wipe the canvas with a gradient, to begin with.
    WIPE gradient:[linear 0,0,200,200 from:black to:gray]
    
    // Setup fill, pen, and an initial transform of x2.
    pen black width:3
    fill none
    
    // Draw a small rect.
    RECT 75,75,150,150
    context [
        // rotate
        rotate 10 anchor:150,150
        
        // The fill and pen will be local to this context.
        fill gradient:[linear 0,0,1,0 from:silver to:blue] relative:yes
        pen none
        
        // Fill a rotated, masked gradient 3d cube silhouette.
        STAR 150,150,6,90,110
    ]
    // This rect will have the same style and transformation as the first.
    RECT 60,60,180,180
![](images/contextDemo.png)

### define

The `define` directive is used to create reusable elements in the document, such as images and fonts. These elements can
be referred to by name in other document parts.

#### define image

You use the `define image` directive to create an image you can reuse throughout the document with the [`IMAGE`](#image)
instruction.

Syntax:

    define image <name> [ resolution:<number>=1 ] <instructions>

-   `<name>` is a unique identifier for the image. Image names are case-sensitive, and you may only define the image
    once.

-   The `resolution` option specifies the resolution factor to use when creating the image. The default value is 1,
    which corresponds to the normal resolution. A value of 2, for example, would use twice the resolution when creating
    the image.

-   `<instructions>` are the graphic instructions that define the image, enclosed in brackets `[` and `]`. The drawing
    context for the image contents does not inherit settings from the current context. A `bounds` directive is required.

When you create an image using the `define image` directive, it will be converted into pixels at the time of definition.
It's important to use a resolution matching the size you plan to use for displaying the image.

See [IMAGE](#image) for an example of how to use `define image`.

#### define font

You can use the `define font` directive to create and embed a font face within the _IVG_ document. The font is defined
using [_ivgfont_](ivgfont%20Documentation.md), a format describing glyphs using SVG paths. Like _IVG_, _ivgfont_ is also
based on _ImpD_.

Syntax:

    define font <name> <definition>

-   `<name>` is a unique identifier for the font face. Font names are case-sensitive, and you may only define the font
    once.

-   `<definition>` is the font face definition in _ivgfont_ format, enclosed in brackets `[` and `]`.

It's worth noting that the `define font` directive is not necessary for referencing fonts provided by the hosting
application, as they can be referred to by name and set with the [`font`](#font) directive, just like embedded fonts.

Example:

    format IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1
    
    // Embed a font called "myEmbeddedFont" with only 3 defined glyphs.
    define font myEmbeddedFont [
        format ivgfont-1 requires:ImpD-1

![](images/defineFontExample.png)

### fill

The fill directive sets the fill style for subsequent drawing operations in the current [context](#context).

    fill <paint>
         [ rule:(non-zero|even-odd)=non-zero]

-   `<paint>` sets the color, gradient, or pattern. See [Paint Specification](#paint-specification) for more
    information.

-   The `rule` option sets the rule used to determine which regions of the path will be filled. The possible values are
    `non-zero` (for the _non-zero winding rule_) and `even-odd`. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule and
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even-odd_rule. The default value is `non-zero`.

### font

The `font` directive updates font settings for the current context. The settings will be used for subsequent text
drawing operations and will be active until they are changed or the current [context](#context) ends or is
[reset](#reset).

Syntax:

    font [ <name> ]
         [ size:<number> ]
         [ color:<paint> ]
         [ outline:<stroke> ]
         [ transform:<transform> ]
         [ tracking:<number> ]

-   `<name>` is the name of the font face to be used. Before drawing text, you are required to set the font name. It can
    be a font previously defined using the [`define font`](#define-font) directive or a font provided by the hosting
    application. If not specified, the font face will not be changed.

-   `size` sets the font size in pixels. One "unit" in the font definition corresponds to this many pixels in size. This
    value usually corresponds to the font height (it's "ascent"). The initial setting is 20.

-   `color` sets the color of the text. The initial setting is `black`. See [Paint Specification](#paint-specification)
    for more information.

-   `outline` sets the outline of the text. It accepts the same arguments as the [`pen`](#pen) directive. Note that the
    outline will be drawn under the fill color, which is the opposite behavior of other shapes. Also, the stroke width
    is twice the regular width because normally, you only see half the stroke (the outer part that is not overdrawn by
    the glyph's interior).

-   `transform` will transform each glyph separately. You express offsets in (size-independent) _em units_.

-   `tracking` adjusts letter spacing in (size-independent) _em units_ (0 is no adjustment).

See [TEXT](#text) for an example of how to set the font.

### mask

The `mask` instruction is used to create a mask that will be applied to subsequent drawing operations. You define the
mask with a set of instructions that draws the mask. The effect of the mask lasts until the end of the current
[context](#context) or until it is [reset](#reset).

Syntax:

    mask <instructions> [ inverted:(yes|no)=no ]

-   `<instructions>` defines the mask. You can use all available drawing directives and instructions. Enclose in
    brackets `[` and `]`.

-   The `inverted` option specifies whether you want to invert the mask or not (default is `no`). When the mask is not
    inverted, it will reveal all painted areas and hide everything else. On the other hand, if the mask is inverted, it
    will hide all painted areas and reveal everything else.

In mask definitions, drawing directives and instructions work like normal, and you can even nest masks in masks. The one
big difference is that a mask is single-channeled (grayscale effectively); therefore, all `<paint>` specifications use a
single value between 0 and 1. Alternatively, you can use a hexadecimal value between `#00` to `#FF`.

A color value of 1 or `#FF` represents the fully opaque color, meaning that (in non-inverted mode) areas painted with
this color will be fully visible, while lower values will result in more transparency.

Initially, the pen (and font outline) is set to `none`, and the fill (and font color) to `#FF` (fully opaque).

### options

`options` is a directive that allows fine-tuning quality settings for the subsequent instructions. Settings are local to
the current [context](#context).

    options [ aa-gamma:<number> ]
            [ curve-quality:<number> ]
            [ pattern-resolution:<number> ]

-   `aa-gamma` allows adjusting gamma correction applied to the edges of strokes and fills to improve anti-alias
    quality. Note that the best quality gamma setting depends on your mixing colors. Settings higher than 1 usually make
    light strokes on dark backgrounds look better, and settings lower than 1 can make drawing dark on light look better.
    The initial value is 1, and the valid range is any number greater than 0.

-   `curve-quality` controls the quality when converting strokes, ellipses, arcs, and splines to polygons. The standard
    value is 1, and the valid range is between 0 and 100.

-   `pattern-resolution` changes the resolution used when creating patterns. A value of 1 uses standard resolution, 2
    uses twice the resolution, and so on. Notice that the effective pixel resolution is chosen with a formula that
    considers the current context transform, and the resolution is always an integer factor.

    ]

### pen

The `pen` directive sets the style of lines and outlines of shapes. The style settings are used for subsequent drawing
operations until they are changed or the current [context](#context) ends or is [reset](#reset).

Syntax:

    pen [ <paint> ]
        [ width:<number> ]
        [ caps:butt|round|square ]
        [ joints:bevel|curve|miter ]
        [ miter-limit:<number> ]
        [ dash:none | (<dash>[,<gap>]) ]
        [ dash-offset:<number> ]

-   `<paint>` sets the color, gradient, or pattern. See [Paint Specification](#paint-specification).

-   The `width` option sets the width of the stroke in pixels. The initial value is 1.

-   The `caps` option sets the shape at the end of open paths. The possible values are `butt`, `round`, and `square`.
    The initial value is `butt`.

-   The `joints` option sets the shape at the corners of paths. The possible values are `bevel`, `miter`, and `round`.
    The initial value is `miter`.

-   The `miter-limit` option controls the maximum ratio of the miter length to the stroke width. The initial value is 2,
    and the valid range is greater than or equal to 1.

-   The `dash` option sets the pattern of dashes and gaps used to stroke paths. When specifying `dash` and omitting
    `gap`, the gap will be the same as the dash length. The initial value is `none`.

-   The `dash-offset` option sets the distance into the dash pattern at which the stroke begins.

The initial pen is `none`. In other words, invisible.

    $drawPath 400 230 [pen dash:20,10 dash-offset:4]
![](images/strokesDemo.png)

### reset

The `reset` directive is used to clear the current state of the drawing context and set it back to the initial state of
the current context.

Syntax:

    reset

Note that `reset` does not take any arguments or options. It simply resets the state of the context to what it was at
the entry of the context. This operation includes resetting the current [mask](#mask), [pen](#pen), [fill](#fill), and
[font](#font) settings and other options associated with the context.

The reset directive does not affect any previously drawn elements on the canvas.

`reset` can be useful for clearing the current state before starting a new drawing or for resetting the state after
applying a series of transformations or other modifications to the context.

## Specifications

### Color Specification

`<color>` is used in many directives, such as [`pen`](#pen), [`fill`](#fill), and [`font`](#font). The syntax for
specifying a color is as follows:

    <color> = rgb(<r>,<g>,<b>[,<opacity>])
              | hsv(<h>,<s>,<v>[,<opacity>])
              | #<hex><hex><hex>
              | #<hex><hex><hex><hex>
              | none
              | ( aqua|black|blue|fuchsia|gray|green|lime|maroon
                  |navy|olive|purple|red|silver|teal|white|yellow )

-   The `rgb` alternative specifies the color using the red, green, and blue components. The values for `<r>`, `<g>`,
    and `<b>` are decimal numbers between 0 and 1, representing the intensity of each component. The optional
    `<opacity>` value is also a decimal number between 0 and 1, where 0 is full transparency, and 1 is full opacity.

-   The `hsv` alternative specifies the color using the hue, saturation, and value components. The values for `<h>`,
    `<s>`, and `<v>` are decimal numbers between 0 and 1, representing the intensity of each component. The optional
    `<opacity>` value is also a decimal number between 0 and 1, where 0 is full transparency and 1 is full opacity

-   The `#<hex><hex><hex>` alternative specifies the color using a hexadecimal RGB value, where each color component is
    between `#00` and `#FF`. This is a common way to specify colors on the web.

-   The `#<hex><hex><hex><hex>` alternative specifies the color using a hexadecimal RGBA value where the RGB values need
    to be pre-multiplied with the alpha value. For example, the color yellow `#FFFF00` with a transparency of 0.75
    (decimal equivalent of `#C0`) becomes `#C0C000C0`.

-   `none` is a special color, meaning that no color will be used; it will be invisible.

-   The last alternative specifies the color using one of the predefined color names.

Colors example:

    format IVG-2 requires:ImpD-1

        if {$x+$w > 480} [ x=20; y={$y+50} ]
        
        // Draw a filled colored box and write the color inside it.

        TEXT at:{$x+$w/2},{$y+25} anchor:center $color
        
        // Next x
        x={$x+$w+20}
    ]
![](images/colorsExample.png)

### Gradient Specification

The `<gradient>` paint type creates a smooth transition between multiple colors. It can be specified with a starting and
ending color or multiple color stops. `<gradient>` is used by the [`<paint>`](#paint-specification) specification, such
as in the [`pen`](#pen) and [`fill`](#fill) directives. The syntax for specifying a gradient is as follows:

    <gradient> = linear <x0>,<y0>,<x1>,<y1> | radial <cx>,<cy>,(<r>|<rx>,<ry>)
                 from:<color> to:<color> | stops:<number>,<color>,[<number>,<color>,...]

-   The `linear` alternative creates a linear gradient that transitions between colors along a straight line defined by
    two points (`<x0>,<y0>` and `<x1>,<y1>`).

-   The `radial` alternative creates a radial gradient that transitions between colors emanating from a single point
    (`<cx>,<cy>`) and spreading outward. You can further define the shape of the gradient by providing either the radius
    (`<r>`), which creates a circular shape or the x-radius and y-radius (`<rx>,<ry>`), which creates an elliptical
    shape.

-   The `from` alternative specifies the start and end colors of the gradient (see [Color
    Specification](#color-specification)).

-   The `stops` alternative allows you to specify multiple color stops at specific positions along the gradient. The
    `<number>`'s represent positions where 0 is the start or center of the gradient, and 1 is the end. The `<color>'`s
    specify the color at that position (see [Color Specification](#color-specification)). It is important to note that
    you must set the stops in ascending order of the `<number>` positions.

Gradient demonstration:

    format IVG-2 requires:IMPD-1
    bounds 0,0,500,500

### Paint Specification

`<paint>` is used in many directives, such as [`pen`](#pen), [`fill`](#fill), [`font`](#font), and others. It can be a
solid [`<color>`](#color-specification) specification, a [gradient](#gradient-specification), or a
[pattern](#pattern-specification). The paint specification provides different ways of specifying how the paint should
look like. You can select a solid color, a gradient of colors, or a pattern.

    <paint> = <color> | gradient:<gradient> | pattern:<instructions>
              [ transform:<transform> ]
              [ relative:yes|no ]
              [ opacity:<opacity> ]

-   The `<color>` paint type specifies a solid color using either RGB, HSV, hexadecimal, or name. See [Color
    Specification](#color-specification).

-   The `gradient` paint type specifies a gradient of colors that can be set with a starting and ending color or
    multiple color stops. See [Gradient Specification](#gradient-specification).

-   The `pattern` paint type is used to specify a repeating graphical pattern created from a set of drawing
    instructions. You define the pattern by enclosing the instructions in brackets `[` and `]`. The drawing context for
    the pattern inherits all settings from the current context, such as [`pen`](#pen), [`fill`](#fill), etc., except for
    the [`mask`](#mask) setting. A [`bounds`](#bounds) directive is required to define the pattern's dimensions. The
    resolution used for rasterizing the pattern can be changed using the [`options`](#options) directive.

-   The `transform` option allows you to apply a series of transformations on the paint. These transformations are
    relative to the current transformation of the active [context](#context). See [Transform
    Specification](#transform-specification). (Irrelevant for solid colors.)

-   The `relative` option allows you to specify whether the paint transforms with the objects drawn. If set to `yes`,
    the paint will be transformed along with the objects. If set to `no` it will stay static. (Irrelevant for solid
    colors.)

-   The `opacity` option allows you to specify the opacity of the paint. The value should be between 0 and 1, where 0 is
    full transparency and 1 is full opacity. Alternatively, you can use hexadecimal values `#00` to `#FF`.

Demonstration:

    bounds 0,0,400,300
    
    // Light gray background.
    WIPE silver
    
    // Fill the canvas with another (mostly transparent) pattern, opacity:0.6.
    WIPE pattern:[
        bounds 0,0,20,20

### Transform Specification

`<transform>` instructions modify the drawing instructions' position, shape, or orientation. You use transformations in
two ways:

1.  You can use a transformation as an instruction of its own to transform the current [context](#context) and all
    subsequent drawing operations. The transformation is applied to the entire canvas when used in this way.

2.  Additionally, transformations can also be used in other directives such as [`<paint>`](#paint-specification),
    [`font`](#font), and [`image`](#image) to transform specific objects. In these cases, you specify the transformation
    within square brackets `[` and `]`, and you can list multiple transformations separated with a semicolon `;`. It is
    important to note that the order of the transformations in the list matters, as transformations are applied in the
    order they appear.

The syntax for specifying a transformation is as follows:

    <transform> = offset <x>,<y>
                  | scale <n>[,<n>]
                  | rotate <degrees>
                  | shear <x>,<y>
                  | matrix <n>,<n>,<n>,<n>,<n>,<n>
                  [ anchor:<x>,<y> ]

-   The `offset` alternative moves the context/object by the specified `<x>` and `<y>` amount.

-   The scale `<n>[,<n>]` alternative resizes the context/object by the specified `<n>` factor. You can provide an
    optional second value to specify a different scaling factor for the x and y-axis.

-   The `rotate` alternative rotates the context/object by the specified `<degrees>` amount.

-   The `shear` alternative skews the context/object by the specified `<x>` and `<y>` amount.

-   The `matrix` alternative applies a transformation matrix to the context/object. The six values provided represent
    the coefficients of the matrix.

-   You can provide an optional anchor point with any of the above alternatives (except `offset`) by appending `anchor`
    to the transformation. `anchor` will specify a point in the context/object that will be used as the base for the
    transformation. By default, the anchor point is the origin (0,0).
